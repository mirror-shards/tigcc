[Description]
Begins the termination handler in a TRY...FINALLY...ENDFINAL block.

[Explanation]
The macro FINALLY ends the protected block and begins the handler for code
which always has to be executed (see <A HREF="$$LINK(TRY)">TRY</A> for more info).
The variable <A HREF="$$LINK(errCode)">errCode</A> is
automatically created in the error handler, and it contains the error number to allow
the program to check what caused the error, or 0 if there was no error.
This variable is destroyed after the <A HREF="$$LINK(ENDFINAL)">ENDFINAL</A> statement.

<B>Note:</B> The macro FINALLY uses the <A HREF="$$LINK(ER_success)">ER_success</A> function to end the protected
block, and <A HREF="$$LINK(ENDFINAL)">ENDFINAL</A> uses <A HREF="$$LINK(PASS)">PASS</A> to throw the
error signaled by <A HREF="$$LINK(errCode)">errCode</A> a second time.

Here is an example (called "Memory Error"), which demonstrates the use of this
macro:
