[Description]
Checks whether an arrow key (TI-89) or status key (TI-92+) is pressed.

[Explanation]
OSGetStatKeys is a strange function: it behaves differently on TI-89
and on TI-92 Plus. On TI-89 it returns ARROW_LEFT, ARROW_RIGHT, ARROW_UP
or ARROW_DOWN if one of the corresponding arrow keys is pressed (these
constants are defined in enum <A HREF="$$LINK(Arrows)">Arrows</A>). On
TI-92 Plus it returns STAT_2ND, STAT_DIAMOND, STAT_SHIFT of STAT_HAND
if one of the corresponding status key is pressed (these constants are
defined in enum <A HREF="$$LINK(StatKeys)">StatKeys</A>). If no arrow keys is
pressed (TI-89) or if no status keys is pressed (TI-92 Plus), this function
returns zero. OSGetStatKeys does not wait for a keypress. If more than
one arrow/status key is pressed, OSGetStatKeys returns a garbage value.

<B>Note:</B> The information about this functions in releases of TIGCCLIB
prior to 2.0 were incomplete: I didn't notice different behaviour on
TI-89 and TI-92 Plus. So, avoid this function in portable programs.
