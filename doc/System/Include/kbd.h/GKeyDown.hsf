[ROM Call]
Index=$17F

[Description]
Checks for currently-available keystrokes.

[Explanation]
Although GKeyDown is different entry in the TIOS jump table than <A HREF="$$LINK(kbhit)">kbhit</A>,
there is no difference between these two functions. GKeyDown just calls
<A HREF="$$LINK(kbhit)">kbhit</A> and does nothing more.
