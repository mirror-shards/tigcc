Home Screen manipulation routines

[Bottom]
<B>Note:</B> In most cases, this header file is used to store expressions in
the Home Screen history. For this purpose, use the
<A HREF="$$LINK(HomeStore)">HomeStore</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(HomeStorePair)">HomeStorePair</A> functions. They are much
less complicated than the other functions manipulating the history.
