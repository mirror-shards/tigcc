[Description]
Creates a new history pair with contents from the expression stack.

[Explanation]
HomeStore performs the same operation as
<A HREF="$$LINK(HomePushEStack)">HomePushEStack</A>. However, the visuals for
storing something to the history with
<A HREF="$$LINK(HomePushEStack)">HomePushEStack</A> will be done immediately,
over top of your program's visuals, if the home screen is the current
application, which it most likely is. This function suppresses this.

However, HomeStore still displays a message in the status bar saying "DATA
PLACED IN HOME SCREEN HISTORY," and turns on the busy indicator.

HomeStore is implemented in assembly, using the following code as a starting
point:
<PRE>CALLBACK void TempHook(EVENT *ev)
{
  ev->Type = CM_IDLE;
}

void HomeStore(void)
{
  EVENT_HANDLER temp = EV_hook;
  EV_hook = TempHook;
  HomePushEStack ();
  EV_hook = temp;
}
</PRE>
