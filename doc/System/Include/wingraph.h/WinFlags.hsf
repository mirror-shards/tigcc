[Description]
An enumeration for describing flags which control the window manager. 

[Explanation]
These flags are used in the <A HREF="$$LINK(WinOpen)">WinOpen</A> command. Usage of
some of them are still not very clear to me. See <A HREF="$$LINK(WinOpen)">WinOpen</A>
to see what I know about them (any additional info is welcomed).
<BR><BR>
WF_DIRTY and WF_VISIBLE are used in event driven applications, see <A HREF="$$LINK(events.h/EV_paintOneWindow)">EV_paintOneWindow</A>
function.
