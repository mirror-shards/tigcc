WinScrollV scrolls the rectangular area determined by <I>rect</I> of the window
pointed to by <I>w</I> upwards by <I>NumRows</I> pixels (or downwards
if <I>NumRows</I>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0). The coordinates in <I>rect</I> are relative
to the topleft corner od the window. Blank areas (i.e. the vacant space produced after
scrolling) are filled with current background for the window (see
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinBackground)">WinBackground</A>).

<B>Note:</B> This command is not very fast because it is realized using
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinBitmapGet)">WinBitmapGet</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(WinBitmapPut)">WinBitmapPut</A>.
