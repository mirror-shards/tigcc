[Description]
Turns the duplicate status on or off.

[Explanation]
WinDupStat turn the duplicate status of the window pointed to by <I>w</I> on
(<I>Stat</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">TRUE</A>) or off
(<I>Stat</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">FALSE</A>). When the duplicate status is
turned off, all writes to a window go only to the screen. When turned on, all writes
go to both the screen and the backup window. This only applies to windows created with
the <A HREF="$$LINK(WinFlags)">WF_DUP_SCR</A> flag set. See <A HREF="$$LINK(WinOpen)">WinOpen</A> for
more info. Beware that duplicate writes slow down all writes to windows with
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinFlags)">WF_DUP_SCR</A> flag set. WinDupStat also returns the previous
duplicate writing status.

window management (especially about overlapping windows) is still very obscure to me.
