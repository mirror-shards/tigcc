[Description]
Draws a filled area between two lines to a window.

[Explanation]
WinFillLines2 fills an area bounded with two lines which coordinates are given
in two <A HREF="$$LINK(WIN_RECT)">WIN_RECT</A> structures <I>lower_line</I> (lower bound) and
<I>upper_line</I> (upper bound) to the window pointed to by <I>w</I>.
In fact, it draws a filled polygon whose vertices are
(<I>lower_line</I>.x0,&nbsp;<I>lower_line</I>.y0),
(<I>lower_line</I>.x1,&nbsp;<I>lower_line</I>.y1),
(<I>upper_line</I>.x0,&nbsp;<I>upper_line</I>.y0) and
(<I>upper_line</I>.x1,&nbsp;<I>upper_line</I>.y1)
using the attribute <I>Attr</I>.
All coordinates are relative to the topleft corner of the window.
Supported attributes are the same as in command
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinFillTriangle)">WinFillTriangle</A>. The drawn polygon will be clipped at the
boundaries of the clipping area of the window. If <I>lower_line</I> is above
<I>upper_line</I>, nothing will be drawn.
To be more precise, "above" means "closer to the top of the screen".
