[Description]
The main window-describing structure (AMS 1.xx version).

[Explanation]
WINDOW_AMS1 is the AMS 1.xx version of the <A HREF="$$LINK(WINDOW)">WINDOW</A>
structure. It is a little smaller, since the last two fields are missing.
Usually, this is not important, but it is a problem if a window structure is
included in other structures (like <A HREF="$$LINK(graphing.h/EQU_DS)">EQU_DS</A>).
