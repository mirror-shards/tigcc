[Description]
Draws a line to a window, more accurately than <A HREF="$$LINK(WinLine)">WinLine</A> when clipping.

[Explanation]
WinLineExt acts like <A HREF="$$LINK(WinLine)">WinLine</A>, except that clipping is done more 
smoothly and drawing is sometimes more accurate: instead of just clipping the coordinates to the 
window clipping area, as <A HREF="$$LINK(WinLine)">WinLine</A> does, WinLineExt draws the line 
between the endpoints, drawing only the pixels that are in the window clipping area.<BR>
This can lead to little differences between a line drawn by 
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinLine)">WinLine</A> and the same line drawn by WinLineExt.<BR>
<BR>
The drawback is that WinLineExt is slower than WinLine.
