[Description]
Draws a border of a window.

[Explanation]
DrawWinBorder is an internal function which draws a border of the window, and optionally
a title bar. The actual dimensions of the border are given in the <A HREF="$$LINK(graph.h/SCR_RECT)">SCR_RECT</A>
structure <I>rect</I>, but all other parameters (border shape, etc.) will be picked from
the structure pointed to by <I>w</I>. Not very useful as a standalone function, although
may be sometimes used in combination with <A HREF="$$LINK(WinBackupToScr)">WinBackupToScr</A>.
Note that you can pass &amp;<I>w</I>.Window as the <I>rect</I> parameter.
