[Description]
A pointer to the desktop window.

[Explanation]
DeskTop is a constant static pointer (i.e. it can't be changed, but the structure pointed to by it
may be changed) which points to the desktop window. This is a window without a border which
occupies the whole screen area except the status line, but the clipping area of this window
is set to exclude the area occupied by the toolbar menu, so you can not draw over the menu
area if you use this window as a parameter to any window drawing function (except if you
changed <I>Clip</I> field of the structure pointed to by DeskTop manually). Usually, if you
want to use a function which expects a parameter
which is a pointer to a window structure, but if you don't want to create your own window,
you can pass DeskTop as the parameter to it (of course, if you don't need to draw something
in the menu or status line area).
