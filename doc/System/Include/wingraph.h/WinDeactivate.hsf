[Description]
Deactivates a window.

[Explanation]
WinDeactivate deactivates a window pointed to by <I>w</I>. In fact, it only changes its border
to the single-line border, without giving a focus to any other window. It is really only needed
if an application has multiple windows. The purpose is to provide a visual clue to the user that
a particular window has lost the current focus and that another window (which will be activated
with <A HREF="$$LINK(WinActivate)">WinActivate</A>) has received the focus. When
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinActivate)">WinActivate</A> is called, the window with the current focus (the last
one to do an activating) is automatically deactivated with WinDeactivate and so it is not
necessary to explicitly call WinDeactivate.
