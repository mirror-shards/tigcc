[Description]
Draws a string to a window.

[Explanation]
WinStr draws the string <I>str</I> to the window pointed to by <I>w</I> at the current pen
location. The current pen location is updated to point to the end of where the string was
written if the window is in TTY mode (see <A HREF="$$LINK(WinOpen)">WinOpen</A> for more description
about window modes). See <A HREF="$$LINK(WinChar)">WinChar</A> routine for a description of character
attributes and fonts.
