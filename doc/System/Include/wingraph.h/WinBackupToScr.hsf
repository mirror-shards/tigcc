[Description]
Shows a current backup screen.

[Explanation]
If the window pointed to by <I>w</I> is active, WinBackupToScreen copies the current backup
screen (duplicate screen) to the real screen (more precise, to the client area of the
window), else does nothing. This routine assumes that a window is opened with the
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinFlags)">WF_DUP_SCR</A> flag (see <A HREF="$$LINK(WinOpen)">WinOpen</A>). Then, all output
to that window is saved in a backup screen image (allocated in the heap). So, this routine
copies the contents of that image to the real screen.
