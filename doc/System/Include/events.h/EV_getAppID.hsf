[Description]
Finds a task ID number for an application.

[Explanation]
EV_getAppID returns a task ID number for the task/application whose internal name is
<I>TaskName</I>, or returns -1 if the application is not found.
Each application (including both built-in applications and external
Flash applications) has a unique internal name (max. 8 characters). This function
is introduced for compatibility with all AMS versions, because
task ID numbers are inconsistent between AMS versions. On AMS 1.xx, built-in flash
applications have fixed ID numbers attached to them, but on AMS 2.xx the task ID is
simply the handle of the application control block (this is why it is quite hard to
add flash applications on AMS 1.xx). So, always use EV_getAppID to determine the
task ID number for an application. Internal names of built-in applications are given
in the following table:

<B>Note:</B> Although this function was not officially introduced before AMS 2.xx, it is
implemented here to work even on AMS 1.xx! However, there is one difference between this
function, and the function with the same name in Flash Studio SDK. This implementation
of EV_getAppID returns -1 if the application is not found, but EV_getAppID from Flash
Studio SDK returns zero under the same conditions. The convention used in Flash Studio
is not consistent with the fact that the "Home screen" application has the ID number 0 on
AMS 1.xx. That's why the value for "not found" is slightly changed in this implementation.
