[Description]
Contains a pointer to the global mode settings array.

[Explanation]
MO_option is a constant pointer to an array of words (unsigned shorts) equivalent to the
<A HREF="$$LINK(MO_OPTIONS)">MO_OPTIONS</A> structure pointed to by
<A HREF="$$LINK(ModeSettings)">ModeSettings</A>. In fact, the definition is almost exactly
the same, only the pointer type differs for compatibility with TI's compiler.
