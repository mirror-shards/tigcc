[Description]
Changes the status (active/inactive) of a menu command in the current application.

[Explanation]
EV_setCmdState is similar to <A HREF="$$LINK(EV_setFKeyState)">EV_setFKeyState</A>, but works with
command pulldown menus associated with the main toolbar menu which belongs to the current application.
EV_setCmdState changes the status of the command item which has its <I>ret_val</I>
(see <A HREF="$$LINK(EV_registerMenu)">EV_registerMenu</A>) equal to the <I>cmd</I>. For example,
if you execute
<PRE>EV_setCmdState (CM_MENU_CUT, FALSE);
</PRE>
in your program, you will see that the "Cut" command in the "Home screen" menu will be disabled
(note that "Home screen" is the current application if you didn't use <A HREF="$$LINK(EV_startApp)">EV_startApp</A>
in your program). <A HREF="$$LINK(EventIDs)">CM_MENU_CUT</A> is, of course, the code of the "Cut" menu command.
