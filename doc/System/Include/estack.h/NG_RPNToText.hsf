[Description]
Detokenizes a tokenized structure associated with a handle.

[Explanation]
NG_RPNToText detokenizes a tokenized structure (an expression, TI-Basic statement or
a group of statements) associated with handle <I>hRPN</I> and
returns a handle to the memory block where detokenized string is stored (you don't need
to allocate anything by yourself, this function will do it instead). The first word of the
data associated with <I>hRPN</I> should be the length of the data which is used to find
the first tag of the tokenized data. It throws an error
if the detokenization fails. This function is mainly identical to
<A HREF="$$LINK(display_statements)">display_statements</A> except NG_RPNToText requires a
handle instead of the pointer to the structure which needs to be detokenized. See
<A HREF="$$LINK(display_statements)">display_statements</A> for more info.
