[Description]
Compares magnitudes of two complex number entries on the expression stack.

[Explanation]
compare_complex_magnitudes compares two complex number entries (which may be real also)
on the expression stack pointed to by
<I>ptr1</I> and <I>ptr2</I>, and returns a value which is
<UL>
<LI>&lt; 0 if the magnitude of the number pointed to by <I>ptr1</I> is less than the magnitude of the number pointed to by <I>ptr2</I></LI>
<LI>== 0 if the magnitude of the number pointed to by <I>ptr1</I> is the same as the magnitude of the number pointed to by <I>ptr2</I></LI>
<LI>&gt; 0 if the magnitude of the number pointed to by <I>ptr1</I> is greater than the magnitude of the number pointed to by <I>ptr2</I></LI>
</UL>
