[Description]
Converts entry on the expression stack to signed short integer.

[Explanation]
estack_to_short converts an entry on the expression stack pointed to by
<I>ptr</I> (it needs to point to the entry tag) to a signed short integer
and stores the result in the location pointed to by <I>value_ptr</I>.
Note that the entry need not be represented by <A HREF="$$LINK(Tags)">POSINT_TAG</A>
or <A HREF="$$LINK(Tags)">NEGINT_TAG</A>: it also may be represented by
<A HREF="$$LINK(Tags)">FLOAT_TAG</A> for example, but the value itself needs to be a whole
number. This function does not remove the entry from the stack.
<BR><BR>
estack_to_short returns 1 if the conversion was successful, 0 in the case of overflow
(in this case the stored result will be -32768 or 32767 depending of the direction
of the overflow), and -1 if the entry can not be represented as a whole number (in
this case the result is undefined).
