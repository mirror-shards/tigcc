[Description]
Evaluates an expressions for graphing purposes.

[Explanation]
NG_graphESI is the function used in TIOS during drawing function graphs. It evaluates
the entry on the expression stack pointed to by <I>ptr</I> in "APPROX" mode then pushes
the result on the top of the expression stack, similar to what <A HREF="$$LINK(NG_approxESI)">NG_approxESI</A>
does, but NG_graphESI requires that all variables in the expression must be defined, i.e.
the expression must evaluate to a number (else "Undefined variable" error will be thrown).
<I>Handle</I> is the handle of the function in which the expression is defined. I don't
know exactly when and why this function needs this handle (probably to check which variables
are parameters of the function, which variables are local etc.). When I tried to pass
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/H_NULL)">H_NULL</A> to this function, nothing bad happened. However, in the absence
of more info, avoid this function.
