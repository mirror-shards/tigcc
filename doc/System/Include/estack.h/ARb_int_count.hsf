[Description]
Represents the number of times arbitrary-integer variables were already used by some calculus.

[Explanation]
Arbitrary-integer variables (of the form "@n<I>x</I>") are generated by TI-Basic function calls such as <CODE>solve(sin(x)=0,x)</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
This variable is set to 0 every time the calculator is reset, or if
<A HREF="$$LINK(bascmd.h/cmd_clrhome)">cmd_clrhome</A> is called.
ARb_int_count wraps back to 0 after 255.
