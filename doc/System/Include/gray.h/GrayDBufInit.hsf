[Description]
Initializes grayscale double-buffering mode.

[Explanation]
GrayDBufInit initializes double-buffering mode. In double-buffering mode, you
can switch between two buffers (using
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufToggle)">GrayDBufToggle</A>) very quickly; much more
quickly than using <A HREF="$$LINK(mem.h/memcpy)">memcpy</A> to achieve
double-buffering. This function assumes that
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOn)">GrayOn</A> has been called and its result was
successful. To have as little extra double-buffering code in the grayscale
implementation as possible, you need to allocate your own buffer and pass it
to this function. You can do this with
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/malloc)">malloc</A>, for example, but be sure to
check its result before proceeding. The necessary size of the buffer (in
bytes) is specified by the constant
<A HREF="$$LINK(GRAYDBUFFER_SIZE)">GRAYDBUFFER_SIZE</A>.
<BR><BR>
You do not explicitly need to call
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufCleanup)">GrayDBufCleanup</A> to deactivate
double-buffering mode; <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOff)">GrayOff</A> will do the
necessary uninitialization. However, be sure to free the buffer after calling
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufCleanup)">GrayDBufCleanup</A> or
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOff)">GrayOff</A>.
<BR><BR>
The contents of the current grayscale buffer become the new contents of the
plane with index 0 (see
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufGetActiveIdx)">GrayDBufGetActiveIdx</A>). The plane
with index 1 is initialized from the new buffer and is filled either with
random contents or with zeroes, depending on the contents of <I>buf</I>. Do
not attempt to change the contents of <I>buf</I> directly after calling
GrayDBufInit.

<B>Note:</B> After calling this function, you should not use the standard
grayscale functions <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayGetPlane)">GrayGetPlane</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(GraySetAMSPlane)">GraySetAMSPlane</A> any more. Instead, use
the double-buffering functions
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufGetPlane)">GrayDBufGetPlane</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufSetAMSPlane)">GrayDBufSetAMSPlane</A> or related
ones.
