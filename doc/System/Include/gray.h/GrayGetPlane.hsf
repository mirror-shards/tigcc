[Description]
Gets the address of a grayscale plane.

[Explanation]
GrayGetPlane returns a pointer to the grayscale plane <I>plane</I>. Valid values for <I>plane</I> are
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayPlanes)">LIGHT_PLANE</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayPlanes)">DARK_PLANE</A>.
To draw in black, draw in both planes.

<B>Note:</B> Do not assume that any plane is on 0x4C00 when in grayscale mode, due to
hardware version 2 support. Also do not assume that the 2 grayscale planes are
consecutive, this is not the case on hardware version 1.
