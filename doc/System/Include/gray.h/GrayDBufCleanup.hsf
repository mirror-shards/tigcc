[Description]
Uninitializes grayscale double-buffering.

[Explanation]
GrayDBufCleanup turns off double-buffering mode, which should have been
previously turned on with <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufInit)">GrayDBufInit</A>.
After calling this function, you can operate in grayscale just like before
calling <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufInit)">GrayDBufInit</A>. You do not need to
call this function explicitly before <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOff)">GrayOff</A>,
as <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOff)">GrayOff</A> will perform the necessary
uninitialization itself.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> GrayDBufCleanup does <I>not</I> free the buffer passed to
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayDBufInit)">GrayDBufInit</A>. You need to do this yourself
afterwards, i.e. after calling this function or
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOff)">GrayOff</A>.
