[Description]
Forces graphics routines to use selected plane.

[Explanation]
GraySetAMSPlane forces all graphics routines (from <A HREF="$$LINK(graph.h/)">graph.h</A>) to draw into
the grayscale plane <I>plane</I> (valid values are <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayPlanes)">LIGHT_PLANE</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayPlanes)">DARK_PLANE</A>). This way you can use standard routines for drawing lines, circles,
etc. in grayscale mode as well. In fact, GraySetAMSPlane is a macro which calls
<A HREF="$$LINK(GrayGetPlane)">GrayGetPlane</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(graph.h/PortSet)">PortSet</A>.
