[Description]
Returns the interrupt handler executed by the grayscale algorithm.

[Explanation]
GrayGetInt1Handler returns the interrupt handler which is called internally by
the grayscale support. Use this function to store the interrupt temporarily
when you are using <A HREF="$$LINK(GraySetInt1Handler)">GraySetInt1Handler</A>
to change it.
<BR><BR>
The interrupt handler called by the grayscale routines looks something like this
(pseudo-code):
<PRE>DEFINE_INT_HANDLER (GrayInt1Handler)
{
  SwitchPlanes ();
  ExecuteHandler (OldInt1);
}
</PRE>
where <I>OldInt1</I> is the previous <A HREF="$$LINK(intr.h/IntVecs)">AUTO_INT_1</A> handler.
GrayGetInt1Handler returns the value of <I>OldInt1</I>.
Note that this is just a C-style declaration of the <A HREF="$$LINK(intr.h/IntVecs)">AUTO_INT_1</A>
handler for grayscale; the actual one is implemented in assembly.
