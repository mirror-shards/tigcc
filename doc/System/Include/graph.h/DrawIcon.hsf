[Description]
Draws an icon.

[Explanation]
DrawIcon draws an icon (a 16x16 bitmap structure given as 16-word group of
bits) pointed to by pointer <I>Icon</I> at location (<I>x</I>,&nbsp;<I>y</I>)
using attribute <I>Attr</I>. Pointer
<I>Icon</I> is usually of type <A HREF="$$LINK(pICON)">pICON</A> (pointer to the
<A HREF="$$LINK(ICON)">ICON</A> structure). The following attributes are supported:
<BR><BR>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING="3">
<TR>
<TD>A_NORMAL</TD><TD>The icon is ORed into the destination</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>A_REVERSE</TD><TD>The inversed icon is ANDed into the destination</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>A_XOR</TD><TD>The icon is XORed into the destination</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>A_SHADED</TD><TD>The icon is masked so that every other pixel is turned off then ORed into the destination</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<BR>
See <A HREF="$$LINK(SetCurAttr)">SetCurAttr</A> command for more general info about attributes.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> In previous releases of TIGCCLIB (prior 2.0) the documentation said that A_REPLACE
attribute is supported. Unfortunately, it seems that this is not true (Daniel Pineo informed
me about this problem). Also, information about usage of A_REVERSE was incorrect.
