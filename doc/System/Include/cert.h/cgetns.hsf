[Description]
Gets a non-aligned short integer from a context.

[Explanation]
cgetns gets a short integer (which does not necessarily need to be aligned on an even address)
from the file associated with the file context pointed to by <I>context</I>, and moves
the file pointer forward by two characters. In fact, it calls <A HREF="$$LINK(cgetc)">cgetc</A>
twice, and combines two returned bytes into one word.
