[Description]
Gets a non-aligned long integer from a field.

[Explanation]
cgetfnl gets a long integer (which does not necessarily need to be aligned on an even address)
from the field described by the structure pointed to by <I>field</I>. The field need
not to be exactly four bytes long; it can be of any length, and cgetfnl gets as many
bytes as are available, up to the size of a long.
