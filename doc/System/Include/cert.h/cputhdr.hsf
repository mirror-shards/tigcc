[Description]
Puts a field header to a context.

[Explanation]
cputhdr puts a field header to the file associated with the file context pointed to by
<I>context</I> and moves the file pointer accordingly. The field header includes
ID word (i.e. field ID number and four length bits), and up to four length bytes if
necessary (see <A HREF="$$LINK(cread)">cread</A> for more info about fields). Required data
for forming the header are taken from parameters <I>FieldID</I> and <I>len</I>.
cputhdr returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">TRUE</A> if the operation was successful, otherwise it returns
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">FALSE</A>.
