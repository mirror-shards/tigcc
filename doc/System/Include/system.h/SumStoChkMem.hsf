[Description]
Compares memory contents by making a checksum.

[Explanation]
SumStoChkMem calculates a checksum of the user portion of the RAM memory (more precisely,
from address 0x400 to 0xFFF (on AMS 1.xx) or to 0xF7F (on AMS 2.xx) and from the bottom of the heap
to the end of the RAM), and stores the calculated value in an internal system variable. It returns
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">TRUE</A> if the calculated checksum is equal to the previous value of
this system variable, else returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">FALSE</A>. So, SumStoChkMem may
be used to check whether the contents of the memory were changed since the last call of
SumStoChkMem (i.e. between two calls of SumStoChkMem).
