[Description]
Fetches a text from the clipboard.

[Explanation]
CB_fetchTEXT stores in the variable pointed to by <I>hText</I> the handle of the text stored
in the clipboard (use <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/HeapDeref)">HeapDeref</A> to get actual pointer to
the text). It also stores the length of the text in the variable pointed to by <I>len</I>.
<BR><BR>
CB_fetchTEXT returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">TRUE</A> if the operation was successful,
else returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">FALSE</A> (i.e. if the clipboard is empty or trashed).
<BR><BR>
AMS will only store text in the clipboard and will always assume that it contains text. However, 
programs may try to store non-text data in it, although it's not a good practice, since it 
might cause strange things to happen on the calculator...
<BR><BR>
The clipboard handle is not locked, so it can be moved during heap compression.
