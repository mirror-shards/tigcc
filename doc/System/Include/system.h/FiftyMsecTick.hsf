[Description]
A counter incremented by the standard system auto-int 5 routine.

[Explanation]
FiftyMsecTick represents the number of times the standard system
<A HREF="$$LINK(intr.h/IntVecs)">AUTO_INT_5</A> routine was executed since the last reset,
if FiftyMsecTick was not modified. Indeed, this variable is changed only by a routine called
at reset, and by the system routine for auto-int 5.

This variable is a way to measure a delay, without using a system timer with
<A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/OSFreeTimer)">OSFreeTimer</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/OSRegisterTimer)">OSRegisterTimer</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/OSTimerCurVal)">OSTimerCurVal</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/OSTimerExpired)">OSTimerExpired</A>, and
<A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/OSTimerRestart)">OSTimerRestart</A>.
<BR><BR>
Note also that unlike all the other system timers, FiftyMsecTick is a countup timer.

Partially emulating FiftyMSecTick on AMS 1.xx is easy with the functions from
<A HREF="$$LINK(intr.h/)">intr.h</A>. However, to fully emulate the functionality, a
memory-resident (TSR) program has to be installed.
