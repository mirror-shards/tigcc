[Description]
Searches for a word in the list.

[Explanation]
WordInList is a useful short routine which returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">TRUE</A> if the
word <I>Word</I> is a member of the list (i.e. array) of words pointed to by
<I>List</I>, otherwise returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">FALSE</A>. The list of words is
terminated by the word 0.
