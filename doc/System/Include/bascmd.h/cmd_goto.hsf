[Description]
Executes TI-Basic 'Goto' command.

[Explanation]
cmd_goto is the main subroutine for executing the TI-Basic Goto statement. It
searches the current TI-Basic program for the label whose name is pointed to
by <I>LabelName</I> (see <A HREF="$$LINK(vat.h/SYMSTR)">SYMSTR</A>. cmd_goto
throws an error if it is not found, otherwise it tells the TI-Basic
interpreter where it is found (by storing its address in an internal
variable). It is not likely that this function may be useful inside a C
program for anything.
