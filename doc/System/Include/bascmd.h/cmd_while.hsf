[Description]
Executes TI-Basic 'While' command.

[Explanation]
cmd_while is an internal subroutine used by the TI-Basic interpreter for
executing 'While'...'EndWhile' loops (searches for a matching 'EndWhile' instruction
and transfers the control there if the condition is not true).
As this function depends heavily on some system state variables of the
TI-Basic intepreter which are not set correctly while executing an ASM
program, it is extremely unlikely that this function may be used inside a C
program for anything useful.

how to use loops in the C language which are similar to While...EndWhile loops
in TI-Basic.
