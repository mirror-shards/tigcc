[Description]
Executes TI-Basic 'DrawFunc' command.

[Explanation]
cmd_drawfunc displays the Graph Screen and draws the expression pointed to by
<I>expr</I> on the screen as a function, using "x" as the independent
variable. For example, to draw the graph of the sine function, you can do:
<PRE>push_parse_text ("sin(x)");
cmd_drawfunc (top_estack);
</PRE>
Note that the drawn graph is not part of the smart graph feature (see the
TI-Basic manual for more info), and that regraphing will erase all drawn
items.
