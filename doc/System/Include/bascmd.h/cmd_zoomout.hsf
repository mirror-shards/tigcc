[Description]
Executes TI-Basic 'ZoomOut' command.

[Explanation]
cmd_zoomout displays the Graph Screen, lets the user set a center point for a
zoom out, and updates the viewing window. The magnitude of the zoom depends
on the TI-Basic system variables "xFact" and "yFact", which determine the
zoom factors. In 3D Graph mode, the magnitude depends on the system variables
"xFact", "yFact" and "zFact". See the TI-Basic manual for more info.
