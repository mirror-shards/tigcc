[Description]
Executes TI-Basic 'EndFor' command.

[Explanation]
cmd_endfor is an internal subroutine used by the TI-Basic interpreter for
terminating the 'For'...'EndFor' loop (searches for a matching 'For' instruction
and transfers the control there if necessary).
As this function depends heavily on some system state variables of the TI-Basic
intepreter which are not set correctly while executing an ASM program, it
is extremely unlikely that this function may be used inside a C program for
anything useful.

For...EndFor loops in TI-Basic.
