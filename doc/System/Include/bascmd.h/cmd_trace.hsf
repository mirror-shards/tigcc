[Description]
Executes TI-Basic 'Trace' command.

[Explanation]
cmd_trace displays the Graph Screen, draws a Smart Graph on it (see TI-Basic
manual for more info about the Smart Graph feature), places the trace cursor
on the first defined 'Y=' function at the previously defined cursor position
(or at the default position if regraphing was necessary), then allows tracing
the graph using the cursor keys.
