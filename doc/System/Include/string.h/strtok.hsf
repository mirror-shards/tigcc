[ROM Call]
Index=$27A

[Description]
Scans <I>s1</I> for the first token not contained in <I>s2</I>.

[Explanation]
strtok considers the string s1 to consist of a sequence of zero or more text
tokens, separated by spans of one or more characters from the separator string
<I>s2</I>. The first call to strtok returns a pointer to the first character of the
first token in <I>s1</I> and writes a null character into <I>s1</I> immediately following
the returned token. Subsequent calls with <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/NULL)">NULL</A> for the first argument will
work through the string <I>s1</I> in this way, until no tokens remain. The separator
string, <I>s2</I>, can be different from call to call. strtok returns a pointer to
the token found in <I>s1</I>. A null pointer is returned when there are no more
tokens.
