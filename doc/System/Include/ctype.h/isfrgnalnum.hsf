[Description]
Checks whether a character is a foreign letter which is valid in a variable name.

[Explanation]
isfrgnalnum is the same as <A HREF="$$LINK(isfrgn)">isfrgn</A>, except small Greek "pi" is excluded,
because it is the reserved symbol and it is not valid in a variable name.
isfrgnalnum is an inline function which is implemented using GNU C smart macros, which expands
to a relatively large code.
