[Description]
Checks whether a character is an extended punctuation character.

[Explanation]
isextpunct returns nonzero if <I>c</I> is a character which is printable
(see <A HREF="$$LINK(isprint)">isprint</A> but which is not an extended alphanumeric
(see <A HREF="$$LINK(isextalnum)">isextalnum</A>), otherwise it returns zero. Extended punctuation
characters include ordinary punctuation characters (see <A HREF="$$LINK(ispunct)">ispunct</A>) and
some extra ones.
isextpunct is an inline function which is implemented using GNU C smart macros. The first call of it
expands to a large code, but any next call of it expands to a relatively small code.
