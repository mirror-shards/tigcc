[Description]
Checks whether a character is an extended alphanumeric.

[Explanation]
isextalnum returns nonzero if <I>c</I> is a symbol which may be used in variable names,
including ordinary alphanumerics (see <A HREF="$$LINK(isalnum)">isalnum</A>), underscore ('_') and
foreign alphanumerics (see <A HREF="$$LINK(isfrgnalnum)">isfrgnalnum</A>), otherwise it returns zero.
It is an inline function which is implemented using GNU C smart macros and a library variable. The first call of isextalnum
expands to a large code, but any next call of it expands to a relatively small code.
