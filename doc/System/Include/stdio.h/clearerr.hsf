[Description]
Resets error indication.

[Explanation]
clearerr resets the error and end-of-file indicators of the stream associated to the structure
pointed to by <I>stream</I> to 0. Once the error indicator is set, stream operations continue to
return error status until a call is made to clearerr or <A HREF="$$LINK(rewind)">rewind</A>.
