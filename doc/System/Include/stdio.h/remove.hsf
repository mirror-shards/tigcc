[Description]
Macro that removes a file.

[Explanation]
remove deletes the file specified by <I>filename</I>. It is a macro that simply
translates its call to a call to <A HREF="$$LINK(unlink)">unlink</A> (name known
from UNIX). So, both remove and <A HREF="$$LINK(unlink)">unlink</A> are equal. Although
ANSI C proposes rename, <A HREF="$$LINK(unlink)">unlink</A> is more common in UNIX programs.
