[Description]
Pushes a character back into input stream.

[Explanation]
ungetc pushes the character <I>c</I> back onto the stream associated with the structure
pointed to by <I>stream</I>. This character will be returned on the next call to
<A HREF="$$LINK(getc)">getc</A> (or related functions like <A HREF="$$LINK(fread)">fread</A>) for that stream.
A second call to ungetc without a call to <A HREF="$$LINK(getc)">getc</A> will force the previous
character to be forgotten. A call to <A HREF="$$LINK(fflush)">fflush</A>, <A HREF="$$LINK(fseek)">fseek</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(fsetpos)">fsetpos</A>, or <A HREF="$$LINK(rewind)">rewind</A> erases all memory of any
pushed-back characters. ungetc returns the character pushed back. ANSI C proposes that it
need to return <A HREF="$$LINK(EOF)">EOF</A> if the operation fails, but in this implementation it
cannot fail. It is implemented as a very simple macro.

<B>Note:</B> ungetc is used in some programs to push back a character to the stream associated with
the keyboard using <CODE>ungetc(c,&nbsp;stdin)</CODE>. This is not possible on TI, because
terminal-associated streams are not supported. Use <A HREF="$$LINK(kbd.h/pushkey)">pushkey</A> instead
to achieve the same effect.
