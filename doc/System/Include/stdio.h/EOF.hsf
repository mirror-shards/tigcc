Definition=#define EOF (-1)

[Description]
Indicates that the end of a file has been reached.

[Explanation]
EOF is a constant which is usually returned as the result of file handling functions if an
end-of-file is reached, or in a case of an error. The ANSI standard does not propose exact value
of this constant, but it proposes that it must be negative.
