[Description]
A structure describing an opened file.

[Explanation]
FILE is the main file control structure for streams. The exact structure of it is very
platform-dependent, so ANSI C proposes that the exact structure of this structured type should not
be known, and well-written programs do not need to access the internal fields of this structure.
