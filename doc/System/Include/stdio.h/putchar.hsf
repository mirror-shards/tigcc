[Description]
Outputs a character to the screen in TTY mode.

[Explanation]
Outputs a character <I>c</I> to the screen in TTY mode. This means the following:
<UL>
<LI>The current print position will be moved in the text line after printing the last character
in the screen line;</LI>
<LI>after printing the last character in the last screen line, the screen will scroll upwards;</LI>
<LI>characters '\n' will be translated to "next line" (and this is the only control code which
has a special implementation);</LI>
<LI>the current print position will be updated after the character is printed.</LI>
</UL>
All TI fonts are supported.

putchar returns the character <I>c</I> (ANSI C proposes returning <A HREF="$$LINK(EOF)">EOF</A> in
a case of error, but printing on TIOS can not fail).
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> In ANSI C, <CODE>putchar(c)</CODE> is equal as <CODE>putc(c,&nbsp;stdout)</CODE>, so it can be redirected
using <A HREF="$$LINK(freopen)">freopen</A>. This is not possible here, because <B>stdout</B>
is not implemented as a file stream.
