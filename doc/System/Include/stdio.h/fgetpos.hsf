[Description]
Gets the current file pointer position.

[Explanation]
fgetpos stores the position of the file pointer associated with the stream associated with
the structure pointed to by <I>stream</I> in the location pointed to by <I>pos</I>
The exact value is irrelevant. On success, fgetpos returns 0. On failure, it returns a nonzero
value.
