[Description]
Callback printing function.

[Explanation]
cbprintf is an alternate entry point to the <A HREF="$$LINK(vcbprintf)">vcbprintf</A> function.
The difference is that the argument is passed directly through the stack instead of through an
argument list pointer.
<BR><BR>
It is implemented here as an assembly wrapper which calls vcbprintf.
