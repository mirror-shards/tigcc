[Description]
Outputs a string to a stream.

[Explanation]
fputs copies the null-terminated string <I>s</I> to the output stream associated to
the structure pointed to by <I>stream</I>.
It does this by calling <A HREF="$$LINK(putc)">putc</A> repeatedly. It does not append a newline
character, and the terminating null character is not copied.
On successful completion, fputs returns the last character written.
Otherwise, it returns a value of <A HREF="$$LINK(EOF)">EOF</A>.
