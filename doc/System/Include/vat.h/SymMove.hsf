[Description]
Moves a symbol.

[Explanation]
SymMove moves the symbol <I>SrcName</I> to the symbol <I>DestName</I>
(see <A HREF="$$LINK(SymFind)">SymFind</A> for rules about <I>SrcName</I> and <I>DestName</I>).
Both <I>SrcName</I> and <I>DestName</I> may also contain a folder name together with the
symbol name (separated by "\"). If none of the names does not contain a folder name,
moving will be simply reduced to renaming. If the destination folder does not exist, a dialog
will appear which asks the user whether a new folder will be created. If the answer is "NO", a
"Folder" error will be thrown. Destination symbol will be deleted before moving, if such
symbol exists. SymMove returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">TRUE</A> if the operation was successful,
else returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">FALSE</A>. This function will even move and rename
locked and archived files; however, upon a reset, they will return to the original name and/or
folder.

<B>Note:</B> Check whether <I>SrcName</I> exists before applying this command, because the
destination symbol <I>DestName</I> (if exists) will be deleted even in a case of an error!
