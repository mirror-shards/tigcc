[Description]
Gets a certificate.

[Explanation]
FL_getCert allocates a space in the RAM and stores in it all relevant information which can
be collected from the certificate area of Flash ROM (which is read-protected). It stores a handle of allocated
space to a variable pointed to by <I>hDest</I>, and stores the length of it in the
variable pointed to by <I>len</I>. <I>decrypt</I> is a Boolean parameter, which
determines whether the crypted part of the certificate will be stored or not (it will be decrypted
before storing, so crypted parts of the certificate are always invisible).
See <A HREF="$$LINK(cert.h/)">cert.h</A> header file for more info.
