[Description]
Collects some useful information about the archive memory.

[Explanation]
EM_survey collects some useful information about the archive memory and stores them
in six variables pointed to by arguments. *<I>inUse</I> is the number of used bytes.
*<I>freedByGC</I> is the number of bytes which will be freed by performing
garbage collection (see <A HREF="$$LINK(EM_GC)">EM_GC</A>). <I>free</I> is the number of
free bytes (not counting bytes occupied by "deleted" blocks, which will become
"free" only after the garbage collection). *<I>unusedSectors</I> is the number of
bytes in "unused" sectors. I don't know why the archive memory contains usually
one unused sector (i.e. sector which is never used for archiving purposes). The
program called "MoreMem" just marks such unused sectors as "sectors in use" to
get more archive memory (?). *<I>badSectors</I> is the number of bytes in bad
sectors, but I am not so sure what "bad sectors" really means.
*<I>allExceptBaseCode</I> is the number of all bytes in the Flash ROM which are not
occupied by TIOS. This argument is new in AMS 2.xx, but you must use six arguments
even on AMS 1.xx. If you don't need a particular information, you may pass
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/NULL)">NULL</A> as the argument. TIOS will see it's a null pointer and will
not save anything in it.
<BR><BR>
TIOS uses only <I>freedByGC</I> and <I>free</I> and always passes
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/NULL)">NULL</A> to everything else. *<I>freedByGC</I>&nbsp;+&nbsp;*<I>free</I>
is used to tell the user how much archive memory is available. Thanks to Johan Eilert for
information how EM_survey should be used correctly on both AMS 1.xx and AMS 2.xx.
