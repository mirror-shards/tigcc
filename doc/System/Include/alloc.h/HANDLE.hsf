[Description]
Represents a handle associated with an allocated memory block.

[Explanation]
The HANDLE type is mainly used to manage dynamically allocated memory using
functions from <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/)">alloc.h</A>, but a lot of functions
from other header files take instances of this type as parameters.
<BR><BR>
A handle points to a word-aligned block of memory, whose current address can
be retrieved using <A HREF="$$LINK(HeapDeref)">HeapDeref</A>.
