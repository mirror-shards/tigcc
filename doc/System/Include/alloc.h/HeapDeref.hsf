[Description]
Dereferences a handle.

[Explanation]
HeapDeref dereferences <I>Handle</I> and returns a pointer to the actual block
of the memory defined by that <I>Handle</I>. Nearly all heap allocation routines
return a "handle" which is an identifier for a block of memory allocated in the heap.
In order to use that memory, the handle must be dereferenced. Once a handle is
dereferenced, that pointer is valid as long as nothing else is done to cause
the heap to be compressed. If the heap is compressed the handle can be
redereferenced to make it valid again. If a handle is locked, then the
pointer that references that block of memory is valid even after the heap is
compressed (since locking a handle means the heap manager will never
move the memory associated with that handle).
