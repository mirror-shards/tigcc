Index=$9E

[Description]
Determines the size of an allocated block.

[Explanation]
HeapSize returns the number of bytes allocated for the heap block referenced by
<I>Handle</I>. Due to word alignment and minimum block size, this may not be the
amount it was allocated with. Also note that because of locked blocks, it is possible
(rare) that a heap block will actually be bumped up a few words by the
<A HREF="$$LINK(HeapCompress)">HeapCompress</A> routine. So never assume that the value
returned by HeapSize is the true number of bytes used by the data stored in the
heap block.
