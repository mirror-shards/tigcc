[Description]
Routines for executing TI-Basic operators

[Top]
Very few of the functions from this header file are documented as of now. Of
course, the ones which are undocumented have not been tested, either. It is
very likely that there are errors in this file, so use it with care.
<BR><BR>
However, we thought it might be a good idea to provide a header file for all
of the built-in TI-Basic operators which have a documented entry in the jump
table.
This way, you can easily search for particular operators if you need them. If
you use a function from this header file, please document it, too.
<BR><BR>
Many functions from this header file require their arguments to have some
specific format. They usually have to be internally simplified, which can be
achieved with the
<A HREF="$$LINK(estack.h/push_internal_simplify)">push_internal_simplify</A>
function from <A HREF="$$LINK(estack.h/)">estack.h</A>, and the result is an
internally simplified expression as well.
<BR><BR>
If you do not want to accept the AMS dependency of these functions, you can
usually construct an expression using their appropriate tags, and then call
<A HREF="$$LINK(estack.h/push_internal_simplify)">push_internal_simplify</A>.

<B>Note:</B> All functions from this header file get parameters from the expression stack, so this
header file must be used in conjunction with <A HREF="$$LINK(estack.h/)">estack.h</A>. You need to
learn about the usage of the expression stack before using any function from this header file.
All functions defined here execute particular TI-Basic operators. They sometimes
may be useful to perform some operations which can not be implemented in C easily. But note that
if you use functions from this header file too much, this will decrease the performance of your
program significantly. In an extreme case, it will in fact decrease to that of a TI-Basic program! So
use functions from this header file only if it is really necessary. Also note that these
functions act exactly like the appropriate TI-Basic commands (including throwing errors if
something is wrong), so the use of an error tracking mechanism from the <A HREF="$$LINK(error.h/)">error.h</A>
header file is highly recommended.
