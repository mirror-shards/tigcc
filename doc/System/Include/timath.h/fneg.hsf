[Description]
Floating point negation.

[Explanation]
fneg returns negated value of floating point argument <I>x</I>.
This routine performs the same operation as the C <CODE>'-'</CODE> unary minus operator applied
to a floating point operand, but it is kept here to allow compatibility with older programs created before
TIGCC introduced floating point operators (i.e. before release 0.9 of TIGCC).
At the fundamental level, fneg is exactly the same routine as
<A HREF="$$LINK(bcdneg)">bcdneg</A>.
