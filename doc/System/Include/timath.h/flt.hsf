[Description]
Converts integer to floating point.

[Explanation]
flt converts the (long) integer argument <I>x</I> to the floating point representation
of the same value. This routine performs the same operation as casting a long integer
value to float type using the <CODE>'(float)'</CODE> typecast operator,
but it is kept here to allow compatibility with older programs created before
TIGCC introduced floating point operators (i.e. before release 0.9 of TIGCC).
This function is automatically called when any floating point function is called with
a long integer argument, to force a promotion of an integer to a floating
point type. In other words, integer values will be automatically promoted to the floating
point type when necessary. So, you can do assignment like <I>b</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<I>a</I>;
when <I>a</I> is an integer variable (or expression) and <I>b</I> is a standard floating
point variable (<B>float</B> or <B>double</B>). Also, you can calculate
sin(<I>a</I>) where <I>a</I> is an integer. In both cases, flt will be called automatically
to perform the promotion. At the fundamental level, flt is exactly the same routine as
<A HREF="$$LINK(bcdbcd)">bcdbcd</A>.
