[Description]
An enumeration for describing item types in menus.

[Explanation]
As these constants are used mainly in "asm" statements, they are defined using a special
method, so they are visible for the built-in assembler (i.e. in "asm" statements).
See the example given with the <A HREF="$$LINK(MenuPopup)">MenuPopup</A> command.
