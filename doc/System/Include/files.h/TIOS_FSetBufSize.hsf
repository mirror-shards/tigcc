[Description]
Set the buffer size of a file.

[Explanation]
FSetBufSize sets the buffer size of the file <I>fsPtr</I> to a new one: <I>newBufSize</I>. 
The buffer size determines how much memory
is reallocated to the file every time a write needs more memory from the
heap. The default size (128 bytes) is set when the file is opened and
should be sufficient for most uses. Setting a larger value will make writes
faster but at the cost of possibly prematurely running out of memory.
<BR><BR>
FSetBufSize returns the value stored in <I>newBufSize</I>.
