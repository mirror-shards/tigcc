[Description]
Gets a CBL file from the link interface.

[Explanation]
LIO_Get is a high-level function which receives a CBL (Calculator-Based Laboratory) file through the link interface and fills
<A HREF="$$LINK(LIO_CTX)">LIO_CTX</A> structure pointed to by <I>file</I> accordingly (note that I don't
know much more about it). LIO_Get returns zero if the operation was successful, else returns a
non-zero value (this value describes the type of the error, but I am not sure about the concrete
meaning of particular values).
