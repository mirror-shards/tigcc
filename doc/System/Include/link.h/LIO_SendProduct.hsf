[Description]
Sends a product code through the link interface.

[Explanation]
LIO_SendProduct is a high-level function which sends a Product Code through the link interface.
What exactly will be sent is described in <A HREF="$$LINK(LIO_CTX)">LIO_CTX</A> structure pointed to by
<I>file</I>. Parameter <I>DevType</I> determines the device type (see <A HREF="$$LINK(LIO_Send)">LIO_Send</A> for
the explanation about its meaning). This routine is called from the VAR_LINK menu.
Returns zero if the operation was successful, else returns a non-zero
value (this value describes the type of the error, but I am not sure about the concrete meaning
of particular values).
