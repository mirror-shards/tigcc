[Description]
Sends a file through the link interface.

[Explanation]
LIO_Send is a high-level function which sends a file (a variable, a screen dump file, etc.)
described by the <A HREF="$$LINK(LIO_CTX)">LIO_CTX</A> structure pointed to by <I>file</I> through
the link interface. However, this function is not so easy for usage, because you need to fill
the file context structure pointed to by <I>file</I> manually before using this function. If
you want just to send a variable through the link interface, function <A HREF="$$LINK(sendcalc)">sendcalc</A>
is much easier to use. The advantage of this routine is greater generality in comparing to
<A HREF="$$LINK(sendcalc)">sendcalc</A> (for example, it allows transfer even between incompatible TI
models, if properly used; sorry, I don't know too much about it).

Parameter <I>DevType</I> determines the device type (this information is stored in the header
of each packet during the communication). It is a collection of flags. Bit b7 is 0 during
transfer from a computer to a calculator and 1 during transfer from a calculator to a computer
or another calculator. Bits b6 and b5 are reserved (keep them to 0). Bit b4 is 1 if a device
is a "special" device, whatever it means (so far, I know that this bit is set if a device is
TI-89 or CBL). Bits b3-b0 determine the calculator type (so far, I know the following meanings:
0010 for TI-82, 0011 for TI83, 0101 for TI85, 1000 for TI-89 or TI-92 Plus, and 1001 for TI-92).
So, <I>DevType</I> should to be 0x98 for sending from TI-89 or 0x88 for sending from TI-92 Plus.

LIO_Send returns zero if the operation was successful, else returns a non-zero value
(this value describes the type of the error, but I am not sure about the concrete meaning of
particular values).
