[Description]
Highlightes the selected text in the editor, and gives the focus to it.

[Explanation]
TE_focus is usually called after <A HREF="$$LINK(TE_select)">TE_select</A>. It highlightes the
selected text in the editor (associated with the structure pointed to by <I>te</I>), and
gives the focus to it, so the selected text will become
active (after this, any keypress will replace selected text with the newly pressed
key). Returns <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">TRUE</A> if focusing was performed, and returns
<A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/Bool)">FALSE</A> if not (for example, if the text was already focused).

<B>Note:</B> TE_focus also enables the cursor using <A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/CU_start)">CU_start</A>
if it was disabled. So, it is sometimes used after calling <A HREF="$$LINK(TE_select)">TE_select</A>
with <I>Low</I>&nbsp;==&nbsp;<I>High</I>, just to
display the cursor.
