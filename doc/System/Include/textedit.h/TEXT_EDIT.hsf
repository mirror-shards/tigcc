[Description]
A structure used to coordinate all text editor operations.

[Explanation]
<B>Note:</B> <I>StartOffset</I> is the first shown character of the entry line,
but it may be covered by an arrow or ellipsis if the corresponding
<A HREF="$$LINK(ETE_FLAGS)">flag</A> is set. <I>SelStart</I> is the position of
the non-extensible end of the selection. This may be either the beginning or
the end of the selection, depending on whether it expands to the right or to
the left. Its value is undefined if there is no selection. <I>CursorX</I> is
the horizontal character position in the line, or position relative to
<I>StartOffset</I>.
