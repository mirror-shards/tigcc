[Description]
Selects a block of text in the editor, or positions the cursor.

[Explanation]
If <I>Low</I>&nbsp;!=&nbsp;<I>High</I>, then TE_select selects all character in the text
editor described by structure pointed to by <I>te</I>, starting from the character with offset
<I>Low</I> up to character with offset <I>High</I> (counted from the begining of the text
buffer). This is the operation which editor usually performs when the user uses shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;arrows.
Note that you don't need to call TE_select often; usually TE_handleEvent will perform wanted
job. This is only needed if you want to select a block of text in the editor independently of
pressing of shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;arrows. Note that selected text will not automatically get a
focus: you need to call <A HREF="$$LINK(TE_focus)">TE_focus</A> to achieve this.

If <I>Low</I> is equal to <I>High</I>, then TE_select
positions the cursor to the position <I>Low</I> (counted from the begining of the text
buffer).
