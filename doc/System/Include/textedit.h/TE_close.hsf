[Description]
Closes the text editor.

[Explanation]
TE_close closes the text editor structure pointed to by <I>te</I>. I am not sure whether
calling this routine is necessary: it performs mainly some irrelevant operations
(like calling <A HREF="$$LINK(TE_unfocus)">TE_unfocus</A>). I also know that TE_close tries
to free the memory occupied by the buffer (by calling <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/HeapFreeIndir)">HeapFreeIndir</A>)
if the editor was opened using <A HREF="$$LINK(TE_openFixed)">TE_openFixed</A>, and if the buffer
was allocated dinamically. So, it seems that it tries to close out a text edit record and to
release its memory automatically. It seems better to me to release the memory manually
(it is more safe anyway).
