[Description]
Basic data types (integer and character).

[Explanation]
Variables of type int are one machine-type word in length. They can be <A HREF="$$LINK(signed)">signed</A> (default)
or <A HREF="$$LINK(unsigned)">unsigned</A>, which means that in this configuration of the compiler
they have by default a range of -32768 to 32767 and 0 to 65535 respectively, but this default
may be changed if the compiler option <B>'-mnoshort'</B> is given. In this case,
the range of type int is -2147483648 to 2147483647 for signed case, or 0 to 4294967295 for
unsigned case. See also <A HREF="$$LINK(short)">short</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(long)">long</A> type modifiers.

Variables of type char are 1 byte in length. They can be signed (this is the default,
unless you use the compiler option <B>'-funsigned-char'</B>) or
unsigned, which means they have a range of -128 to 127 and 0 to 255,
respectively.

All data types may be used for defining variables, specifying return types of functions, and
specifying types of function arguments. For example,
<PRE>int a, b, c;                       // <I>'a', 'b', 'c' are integer variables</I>
int func ();                       // <I>'func' is a function returning int</I>
char crypt (int key, char value);  // <I>'crypt' is a function returning char with</I>
                                   // <I>two args: 'key' is int and 'value' is char</I>
</PRE>
When function return type is omitted, <CODE>int</CODE> is assumed.

All data type keywords may be used in combination with <A HREF="$$INFOLINK(opers/asterisk)">asterisks</A>, <A HREF="$$INFOLINK(opers/subscr)">brackets</A>
and <A HREF="$$INFOLINK(opers/parentheses)">parentheses</A>, for making complex data types, like
pointer types, array types, function types, or combinations of them, which in the C language may
have an arbitrary level of complexity (see <A HREF="$$INFOLINK(opers/asterisk)">asterisk</A> for
more info).
