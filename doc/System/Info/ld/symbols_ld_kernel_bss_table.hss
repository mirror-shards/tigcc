Usually, this symbol is simply resolved to a user-defined symbol named
<CODE>__kernel_bss_table</CODE>. However, if the program does not contain a
BSS section, it is redirected to the entry point of the program. The effect
is that constructs of the form
<PRE>.word __ld_kernel_bss_table-<I>entry_point</I>
</PRE>
resolve to 0 if no BSS section is used.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> If a program/library defines <CODE>__kernel_bss_table</CODE>, it
absolutely <I>must</I> handle the BSS section. See
<A HREF="$$LINK(insert_kernel_bss_refs)">__ld_insert_kernel_bss_refs</A> for
a way to get information about references into the BSS section.
