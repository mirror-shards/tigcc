Defining _flag_<I>n</I> sets the <I>n</I>-th bit in the kernel compatibility
flags. Some flags are reserved for calculator compatibility information (see
<A HREF="$$LINK(control_calc)">here</A>); the others can be used to pass
additional information to the kernel. Note that the meaning of a particular
flag may vary between kernels. Kernel flags occupy a single byte; therefore
the range of <I>n</I> is 0 through 7.
