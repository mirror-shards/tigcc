Title=ar-tigcc Command-Line Options

[Top]
The <CODE>ar-tigcc</CODE> tool can be used to create archives recognized by
<CODE>ld-tigcc</CODE>. The output format is the format used by
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A> <CODE>ar</CODE>, for which this tool is
a replacement. This allows for maximum compatibility between archives and
programs created with different versions of TIGCC.
<BR><BR>
In <CODE>ar-tigcc</CODE>, options and input files may appear in any order in
the command line. Input files can have any file format; they are simply
written into the archive in the order specified in the command line. However,
object files whose format is recognized are searched for exported symbols, so
that <CODE>ar-tigcc</CODE> can create a symbol table for the archive.
<BR><BR>
If no output file name is specified, <CODE>ar-tigcc</CODE> uses the name of
the first input file and appends a <CODE>'.a'</CODE> extension to it. It is
highly recommended that you specify a different name with the
<CODE>'--output'</CODE> option.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>ar-tigcc</CODE> recognizes the following options:
<DL>
<DT><B>-h</B>
<BR><B>--help</B>
<DD>Print a short description of all available options.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>--version</B>
<DD>Print the version number of the tool and a short copyright notice.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>--dump</B>
<DD>Display a small dump of the archive file contents. This includes the
members as well as the symbols they export.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-o <I>file</I></B>
<BR><B>--output <I>file</I></B>
<BR><B>-rc <I>file</I></B>
<BR><B>-qc <I>file</I></B>
<DD>Write the output to the file named <I>file</I>. Unlike
<CODE>ld-tigcc</CODE>, <CODE>ar-tigcc</CODE> does not append a file extension
to <I>file</I>. <B>'-rc'</B> and <B>'-qc'</B> are recognized for
compatibility with GNU <CODE>ar</CODE>, so that certain command lines work
with GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> as well as <CODE>ar-tigcc</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>--no-names</B>
<DD>Omit the file names of the input files in the archive. The archive will
only contain names of the form <CODE>fl<I>n</I>.o</CODE>, where <I>n</I> is
the index of the file starting at 1. Omitting file names may be a good idea,
especially if you use long file names, since the traditional archive format
imposes a maximum of 15 characters on the length of file names. Otherwise, if
a file name exceeds this maximum, it will be cut off at the 16th character.
The IDE and the <CODE>tigcc</CODE> command line compiler always use this
option.
