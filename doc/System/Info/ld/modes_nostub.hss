Title=Nostub Linking Mode

[Top]
If this mode is activated using the
<A HREF="$$LINK(control_nostub)">_nostub</A> control symbol, execution will
start at the very beginning of the program. The exact entry point depends on
the order of the object files as passed to the linker as well as the order of
the sections inside an object file. Because of this insecurity, this mode
should never be used in new programs. Programs written in assembly should
define a small <A HREF="$$LINK(startup)">startup section</A> including a jump
to the actual main function and use
<A HREF="$$LINK(modes_native)">TIGCC-native mode</A> instead. If the main
function follows immediately, the jump can even be optimized away by the
linker.
<BR><BR>
If a startup section is defined in nostub mode, the linker emits a warning
and switches to <A HREF="$$LINK(modes_native)">TIGCC-native mode</A>. This
ensures that nostub mode really means that no stub is added to the program.
