Title=Kernel Linking Mode

[Top]
In this mode, which is enabled by default, the linker acts the same way as in
<A HREF="$$LINK(modes_native)">TIGCC-native mode</A>, but it creates a
<A HREF="$$LINK(global_imports)">global import</A> asking for the appropriate
kernel format header. See <A HREF="$$LINK(global_imports_auto)">Automatically
Created Global Imports</A> for more information.
