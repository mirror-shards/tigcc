Title=Flash OS Linking Mode

[Top]
This mode creates an unsigned Flash operating system upgrade for the TI-89,
TI-92+ and Voyage 200 calculators. (TI-89 Titanium Flash upgrades are
currently <I>not</I> supported.) It can be turned on using the
<B>'--flash-os'</B> <A HREF="$$LINK(invocation_ld)">command-line option</A>
or the <A HREF="$$LINK(control_flash_os)">_flash_os</A> control symbol. It
currently supports only the raw TIB output format, which is enabled by the
<B>'--outputbin'</B> <A HREF="$$LINK(invocation_ld)">option</A>. Support for
the current 89u/9xu/v2u format is planned and will be the default. It creates
a <A HREF="$$LINK(global_imports)">global import</A> asking for the
appropriate Flash OS header (see
<A HREF="$$LINK(global_imports_auto)">Automatically Created Global Imports</A>
for more information). Since Flash operating systems are composed of 2
discontiguous parts, a small (24 KB) startup segment and a large (1944 KB for
2 MB FlashROMs, 3992 KB for 4 MB FlashROMs) main segment,
<A HREF="$$LINK(startup)">startup sections</A> are handled in a special way
in this mode: Startup sections are placed into the startup segment, all other
sections are merged into the main segment.

<B>Note:</B> Flash OS support must be compiled in for this mode to be
available.
