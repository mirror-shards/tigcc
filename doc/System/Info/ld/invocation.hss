The TIGCC linker is available in two forms: As a standalone command line
program or as a dynamic link library (DLL). TIGCC uses the DLL version for
improved speed and to avoid maintainance problems, but experienced
programmers might want to use the command line version in some cases because
it is a little more advanced.

In the <A HREF="$$INFOLINK(ide)">IDE</A>, linker options can be set in the
project settings. The <CODE>tigcc</CODE> command line compiler accepts most
of the options of <CODE>ld-tigcc</CODE> and passes them to the linker.
