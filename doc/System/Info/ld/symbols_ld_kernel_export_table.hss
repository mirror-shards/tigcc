Usually, this symbol is simply resolved to a user-defined symbol named
<CODE>__kernel_export_table</CODE>. However, if the program does not contain
any exported symbols, it is redirected to the entry point of the program. The
effect is that constructs of the form
<PRE>.word __ld_kernel_export_table-<I>entry_point</I>
</PRE>
resolve to 0 if no exports exist.
