Title=C++ Style Comments

[Top]
In GNU C, you may use C++ style comments, which start with <CODE>//</CODE> and
continue until the end of the line.  Many other C implementations allow
such comments, and they are included in the 1999 C standard.  However,
C++ style comments are not recognized if you specify an <B>'-std'</B>
option specifying a version of ISO C before C99, or <B>'-ansi'</B>
(equivalent to <B>'-std=c89'</B>).
