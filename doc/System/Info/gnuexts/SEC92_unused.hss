Title=unused

[Top]
When attached to a type (including a <CODE>union</CODE> or a <CODE>struct</CODE>),
this attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for any variables of
that type, even if the variable appears to do nothing.
<BR><BR>
The <CODE>unused</CODE> attribute can also be used for <A HREF="$$LINK(SEC85_unused)">functions</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(SEC91_unused)">variables</A>.
