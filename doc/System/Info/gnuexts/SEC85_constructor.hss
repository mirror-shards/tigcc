[Main]
Title=constructor, destructor

[Top]
The <CODE>constructor</CODE> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically before execution enters _main.  Similarly, the
<CODE>destructor</CODE> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically after _main has completed or <A HREF="$$LINK(stdlib.h/exit)">exit</A> has
been called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
initializing data that will be used implicitly during the execution of
the program.
