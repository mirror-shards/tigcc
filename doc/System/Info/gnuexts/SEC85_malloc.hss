Title=malloc

[Top]
The <CODE>malloc</CODE> attribute is used to tell the compiler that a function
may be treated as if it were the <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/malloc)">malloc</A> function.  The compiler assumes
that calls to <A HREF="$$LINK(alloc.h/malloc)">malloc</A> result in a pointers that cannot alias anything.
This will often improve optimization.
