Title=String Literals with Embedded Newlines

[Top]
As an extension, GNU CPP permits string literals to cross multiple lines
without escaping the embedded newlines.  Each embedded newline is
replaced with a single <CODE>\n</CODE> character in the resulting string
literal, regardless of what form the newline took originally.
<BR><BR>
CPP currently allows such strings in directives as well (other than the
<CODE>#include</CODE> family).
