This part of the documentation is a modified version of the <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Extensions.html">C Extensions</A> section of the <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/">GCC Manual</A>.

TIGCC (like all GNU C compilers) provides several language features not found
in ISO standard C.  To test for the availability of these
features in conditional compilation, check for a predefined macro
<CODE><A HREF="$$INFOLINK(cpp/SEC15_GNUC)">__GNUC__</A></CODE>, which is always defined under GCC.
<BR><BR>
Some features that are in ISO C99 but not C89 are also, as
extensions, accepted by GCC in C89 mode.
