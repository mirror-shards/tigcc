Title=Binary Numbers

[Top]
TIGCC allows you to specify binary numbers by using a <CODE>0b</CODE> prefix.  This can be handy
in many occasions, such as when trying to declare sprites in a way which actually allows you to see
the picture.  For example, the following declaration defines a simple black and white 8x8 diagonal
cross:
<PRE>unsigned char cross[8] =
 {0b10000001,
  0b01000010,
  0b00100100,
  0b00011000,
  0b00011000,
  0b00100100,
  0b01000010,
  0b10000001};
</PRE>
