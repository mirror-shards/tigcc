Title=packed

[Top]
The <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
should have the smallest possible alignment - one byte for a variable,
and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
<CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute.
<BR><BR>
Here is a structure in which the field <CODE>x</CODE> is packed, so that it
immediately follows <CODE>a</CODE>:
<PRE>struct foo
{
  char a;
  int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
};
</PRE>
