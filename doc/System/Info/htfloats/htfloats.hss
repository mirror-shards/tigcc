Title=Using Floating Point Arithmetic

[Top]
If you have used earlier releases of TIGCC (prior to 0.9), you probably know that the use of floating
point values and functions was possible, but only using some very awkward syntax, which caused a lot of
headaches and nightmares. The TIGCC team (mostly
<A HREF="mailto:SebastianR@gmx.de">Sebastian Reichelt</A> and
<A HREF="mailto:zjuric@utic.net.ba">Zeljko Juric</A>) spent a lot
of time and effort implementing native (ANSI) floats in TIGCC. And the results are now available:
you can use regular floating point numbers and values now, as in all regular C compilers! This means
that:
<UL>
<LI>
You can now use the standard ANSI types <CODE>float</CODE>, <CODE>double</CODE> and
<CODE>long&nbsp;double</CODE> without any trouble (in fact, these three types are the same,
there is no difference between them). The old-style type <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/ti_float)">ti_float</A>
still exists due to compatibility reasons, but now it is the same as <CODE>float</CODE>.
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
You can now use "standard" floating point constants (like 2.854). So, the following is now valid:
<PRE>float a, b, c;
a = 2.854;
b = 7;
c = 1.5e-7;
</PRE>
In other words, no more ugly <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/M_FLT)">FLT</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/M_FEXP)">FEXP</A> macros! They still exist due to compatibility reasons,
but their usage is very deprecated now.
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
You can now use standard arithmetic ('+', '-', '*', '/) and comparison ('&lt;', '&gt;',
'&lt;=', '&gt;=', '==' and '!=') operators with floating point values. There is no need any more
for the use of awkward functions like <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fadd)">fadd</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fcmp)">fcmp</A> etc. So statements like these are now accepted:
<PRE>p = (q + 3.15) / (q - r);
x1 = (-b + sqrt (b * b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);
if (p &lt; 3.0) q += 1e-3;
</PRE>
This feature is probably the best present for TIGCC users...
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
You can use all floating point functions (like <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/sqrt)">sqrt</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/sin)">sin</A> etc.) as usual. In this release, a standard ANSI
math library <A HREF="$$LINK(math.h/)">math.h</A> is implemented, which contains nearly all
functions proposed by ANSI C, with some extensions. The old
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/)">timath.h</A> library file still exists due to compatibility reasons,
and it contains more functions than <A HREF="$$LINK(math.h/)">math.h</A>, because it contains
some functions for making compatibility with older programs, and some functions which are
internally related to the TIOS. Anyway, you can do calculations like these:
<PRE>a = sin (b);
b = exp (1);
c = log (3.19);
a = sqrt (b + c) * sinh (a / 2.);
</PRE>
As you can see from the second example, automatic promotion from integer constants to
the floating point is also implemented.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Integer types are now automatically promoted to floating point values when necessary, as
proposed in ANSI C. This means that the following constructions are valid, assuming that
<CODE>'n'</CODE> is a variable of integer (short, long, signed, unsigned) type:
<PRE>a = n;
b = sqrt (n);
c = b + n;
</PRE>
You can also explicitely cast an integer value to a floating point one:
<PRE>a = (float)n;
</PRE>
The function <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/flt)">flt</A> which performs the promotion explicitely
still exists, due to compatibility reasons.
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Floating point types are automatically truncated to integers when the program
expects an integer value (for example, when a floating point variable is assigned to an integer
variable), as proposed in ANSI C. This means that you can write
<PRE>n = a;
</PRE>
where <CODE>'n'</CODE> is an integer, and <CODE>'a'</CODE> is a float, although it is better
to express your wish more explicitely using type cast as
<PRE>n = (int)a;</PRE>
The function <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/trunc)">trunc</A> which performs the
truncation explicitely still exists due to compatibility reasons.
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
You can use <A HREF="$$LINK(stdio.h/printf)">printf</A> and similar
functions to print floating point values, using the format specifiers <CODE>%f</CODE>,
<CODE>%e</CODE> and <CODE>%g</CODE>, as defined in ANSI C. So, the following is
completely legal:
<PRE>printf ("sin(%f)=%f", a, sin(a));
printf ("%f", 3.14);</PRE>
Note that the second statement was not valid prior to release 0.9 of TIGCC!
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
To accept a floating point value from the keyboard, first accept it as a string (using
<A HREF="$$LINK(stdio.h/gets)">gets</A>, some user-written input routine, or
functions from <A HREF="$$LINK(dialogs.h/)">dialogs.h</A>), then
convert the string to a floating point value using the <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/atof)">atof</A>
(ascii-to-float) function. To get a floating point argument passed from TI-Basic to the
program, use the <A HREF="$$LINK(args.h/GetFloatArg)">GetFloatArg</A> function.
</LI>
</UL>
As you can see, the usage of floats with TIGCC is now essentially the same as in all other C
compilers. See the description of the <A HREF="$$LINK(math.h/)">math.h</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/)">timath.h</A> header files for more info. However, floating point
support in TIGCC is not perfect yet. That's why there are still some limitations
in the use of floating point values (fortunately, they are not serious):
<UL>
<LI>
The promotion of unsigned long integers which are too big to fit in a long integer type
(i.e. values between 2147483648 and 4294967295) does not work correctly: The promoted value
will be negative.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
The promotion of double long integers (<A HREF="$$INFOLINK(gnuexts/SEC72)">long long</A> types) to
floating point values, and truncation of floating point values to longlongs are not implemented
yet. If you try to do this (which is not very likely), you will get an "undefined reference"
error during the linking stage.
</LI>
</UL>
As an example of usage of floating point values and functions, the program given below
(called "Float Test") reads coefficients of a quadratic equation from the keyboard, then
calculates and displays the solutions of the equation (including complex ones):
$$EXAMPLE(Float Test.c)
See the description of the included header files for more info about the functions used.
<BR><BR>
As already mentioned above, the new floating point support is implemented without
losing compatibility with programs written with releases of TIGCC before 0.9
(more precise, the degree of compatibility is about 95%; read further to see possible
reasons of incompatibility). So, the quadratic equation solver given below, which
is written using old methods (prior to TIGCC 0.9), will still work with a new compiler.
Compare this (old-style) code with the previous (new-style) one to see how much clearer
the new-style code is...
<PRE>#define SAVE_SCREEN

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;timath.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;kbd.h&gt;

int _ti89, _ti92plus;

void _main (void)
{
  ti_float a, b, c, d;
  char buffer[200];
  clrscr ();
  puts ("a=");
  a = atof (gets (buffer));
  puts ("b=");
  b = atof (gets (buffer));
  puts ("c=");
  c = atof (gets (buffer));
  if (is_nan (a) || is_nan (b) || is_nan (c)) return;
  d = fsub (fmul (b, b), fmul (FLT (4), fmul (a, c)));
  if (fcmp (d, ZERO) &gt;= 0)
    {
      ti_float x1, x2;
      x1 = fdiv (fadd (fneg (b), sqrt (d)), fadd (a, a));
      x2 = fdiv (fsub (fneg (b), sqrt (d)), fadd (a, a));
      printf ("\nx1=%f\nx2=%f", x1, x2);
    }
  else
    {
      ti_float re, im;
      re = fdiv (fneg (b), fadd (a,a));
      im = fabs (fdiv (sqrt (fneg (d)), fadd(a, a)));
      printf ("\nx1=%f-%f*i\nx2=%f+%f*i", re, im, re, im);
    }
  ngetchx();
}
</PRE>
The possible reasons which may cause incompatibility (very unlikely) with programs written
with older versions of TIGCC (prior to 0.9) are:
<UL>
<LI>
The types <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/ti_float)">ti_float</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcd)">bcd</A>
are not the same any more.
<CODE>ti_float</CODE> is now equal to ANSI type <CODE>float</CODE>, but
<CODE>bcd</CODE> is still a structure. If your program uses the
<CODE>bcd</CODE> type (not very likely), you should probably change it to
<CODE>float</CODE> to make the program work, because functions which expect a
<CODE>float</CODE> type will not accept a structured type. Two macros called
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/float_to_bcd)">float_to_bcd</A> and
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcd_to_float)">bcd_to_float</A> have been introduced to provide more general
conversion if necessary.
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Functions <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fadd)">fadd</A>, <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fsub)">fsub</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fmul)">fmul</A>, <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fdiv)">fdiv</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fneg)">fneg</A>, <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/fcmp)">fcmp</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/flt)">flt</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/trunc)">trunc</A> are not
absolutely equal to functions
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcdadd)">bcdadd</A>, <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcdsub)">bcdsub</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcdmul)">bcdmul</A>, <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcddiv)">bcddiv</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcdneg)">bcdneg</A>, <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcdcmp)">bcdcmp</A>,
<A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcdbcd)">bcdbcd</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcdlong)">bcdlong</A> any more.
The first group of functions now works with the ordinary <CODE>float</CODE> type (and they
will continue to work with <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/ti_float)">ti_float</A>), but the second
group now only works with <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcd)">bcd</A> structures. So, if you used
<CODE>bcdadd</CODE> etc. in your program (not very likely), you should
probably change it to <CODE>fadd</CODE> etc. to make the program work.
</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Suppose that your old program uses the <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/ti_float)">ti_float</A> type with
direct access to its internal fields (not very likely), like in the following example:
<PRE>ti_float a;
a.exponent = 0x4003;
a.mantissa = 0x3284300000000000;
</PRE>
Then the program will not work with the new compiler, because <CODE>ti_float</CODE> is not a
structure any more. Using a new macro <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcd_var)">bcd_var</A> you can easily
get your program to work. All you need to do is to re-express the above statements as
<PRE>ti_float a;
bcd_var(a).exponent = 0x4003;
bcd_var(a).mantissa = 0x3284300000000000;
</PRE>
Note, however, that the <A HREF="$$LINK(timath.h/bcd)">bcd</A> type is still a structure.
