I really need a routine like InputStr given above, but which is able to bring up the CHAR
dialog. However, I am not able to make such routine by myself...

I received a lot of such questions. These questions are usually asked by newbie programmers,
but the answer is quite advanced. Although I don't like to present advanced routines
as-is without a lot of necessary explanations, I am requested to do so. Well, here is a
routine (example "Input String Advanced"):
$$EXAMPLE(Input String Advanced.c)
It will be good if you can understand how it works (I recommend reading the documentation
for the <A HREF="$$LINK(events.h/)">events.h</A> header file). Note that this
example used to be broken in previous releases of TIGCC, as it took the address
of a <A HREF="$$INFOLINK(gnuexts/SEC66)">nested function</A>, a
<A HREF="$$INFOLINK(gnuexts)">GNU C Extension</A> which didn't work correctly at that time.
