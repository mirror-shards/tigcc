My program is leaking some small amount of memory (less than 100 bytes). Where could my leak possibly be?
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A:</B></TD><TD>
The reason is probably the home screen history. Press F1 and 8 before and
after running your program, and if it is still leaking memory
then you need to be concerned.
