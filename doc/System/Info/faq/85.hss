How do you make that the status line is not visible on the screen so that the
status indicators do not mess up your graphics?
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A:</B></TD><TD>
The most general method (I use this) is: disable auto-int 1 using
<A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/OSSetSR)">OSSetSR</A> function (status line indicators are updated
from this interrupt). Note that in this case you need to read the keyboard using the
<A HREF="$$LINK(kbd.h/_rowread)">_rowread</A> function, because
<A HREF="$$LINK(kbd.h/ngetchx)">ngetchx</A> etc. are based on auto-int 1. I used this method
in my program cblaster (you can pick it from ticalc). Anyway, if you use
<A HREF="$$LINK(kbd.h/_rowread)">_rowread</A>, you should also disable auto-int 5 as well.
