Title=Starting a New Assembly Project

[Top]
To start a new Assembly project, you have to perform the same steps as for a C project; the only difference is that you have to click on 'New/GNU Assembly Source File' or 'New/A68k Assembly Source File' instead.  Note that you can also have a mixed project with both file types.  Assembly projects are not supported and tested as well as C projects.
