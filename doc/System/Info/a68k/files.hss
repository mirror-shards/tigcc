<CODE>A68k</CODE> uses the following files:
<UL>
<LI>
The source code file - this file contains the program to be
assembled.  This file is an ASCII text file whose last line
must be an <CODE>END</CODE> statement.
<TABLE><TR><TD><B>(TIGCC)</B></TD><TD>
This <CODE>END</CODE> statement is no longer necessary starting
from v.2.71.F3c.<BR>
Moreover, the assembler will no longer accept an <CODE>END</CODE>
statement in include files or macros, since it did
never expect that and caused bugs.</TD></TR></TABLE>
</LI>
<LI>
The object code file - this file is created by <CODE>A68k</CODE>, replacing
any previous version which may exist.  If any errors are
encountered during the assembly, this file will be scratched,
unless the <B>'-k'</B> (keep) switch is specified (see below).
Although this file is normally written in AmigaDOS format,
the <B>'-s'</B> switch (see below) will cause it to be written in
Motorola S-record format instead.
</LI>
<LI>
The listing file - this file is optionally created by <CODE>A68k</CODE>
and contains a listing complete with page headings (including
form feeds), generated object code, and error messages if any.
It is suitable for feeding to a printer.
</LI>
<LI>
An equate file - this file is optionally created by <CODE>A68k</CODE>
and consists of a leading comment line followed by <CODE>EQU</CODE>
statements, one for each symbol encountered by <CODE>A68k</CODE> whose
value is absolute.  This file is only created if the <B>'-e'</B>
command-line switch is specified (see below).
</LI>
<LI>
A header file - if requested, this file is read by <CODE>A68k</CODE>
immediately prior to the source code file.  It treated
exactly as if it were requested by an <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> statement
at the front of the source file, but is selected only if
the <B>'-h'</B> command-line switch is specified (see below).
</LI>
<LI>
Include files are selected by <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> directives within the
source file, and are inserted in the source code in place
of the <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> directive itself.  <CODE>A68k</CODE> first searches the
current directory for <CODE>INCLUDE</CODE> files; the <B>'-i'</B> command-line
switch (see below) specifies additional directories which
can be searched.
</LI>
</UL>
