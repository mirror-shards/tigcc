In nostub mode, if you put
<PRE>#define COMPRESSED_FORMAT_BSS
</PRE>
at the beginning of the program, a BSS section will be created dynamically at
run time, and the references into this section will be stored in the program
in a compressed format. A BSS section holds uninitialized global variables.
Relocation entries in this format take the smallest space that is reasonable.
The relocation code for the compressed format is rather large, but part of it
only has to be inserted into the program once if multiple
<CODE>COMPRESSED_FORMAT_...</CODE> features are used.

This feature uses the linker-specific symbol
<A HREF="$$INFOLINK(ld/insert_compressed_bss_refs)">__ld_insert_compressed_bss_refs</A>.
