Title=COMMENT_STRING

[Top]
To define a comment string, write
<PRE>#define COMMENT_STRING "<I>comments</I>"
</PRE>
at the top of your source code. If supported by the target format, this will
include the text inside the quotes as a comment string. It can be arbitrary
text, but as a general rule, it should fit into the status line of a TI-89.
