Title=Wrapping a ROM Function in tigcc.a

[Top]
Sometimes a ROM function exists as a normal ROM call in the jump table, but
for some reason it is not usable in a direct way. This means that it has to
be implemented either using macros or using a wrapper function in
<CODE>tigcc.a</CODE>.

This does not have to be related to an AMS dependency; it may also be
because of a bug in the AMS, or because of some missing feature.
