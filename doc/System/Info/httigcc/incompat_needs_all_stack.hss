Title=INCOMPAT_NEEDS_ALL_STACK

[Top]
If your program needs the entire stack (or almost the entire stack) to be
free, you should write
<PRE>#define INCOMPAT_NEEDS_ALL_STACK
</PRE>
at the top of at least one source file, before including any header file
from the TIGCC Library.
This will prevent shells that fill up part of the stack from executing the
program.
