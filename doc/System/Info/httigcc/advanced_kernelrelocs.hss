In nostub mode, if you put
<PRE>#define KERNEL_FORMAT_RELOCS
</PRE>
at the beginning of the program, relocation entries will be stored and
relocated in the same manner as kernel programs do it. This does <I>not</I>
mean that your program will need a kernel to run. The kernel format for
relocation information is always smaller than the native TIOS format, but the
relocation code will take up a few bytes. You need to see for yourself
whether using it makes the program smaller.
