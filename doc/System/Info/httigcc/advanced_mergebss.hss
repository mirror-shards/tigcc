In nostub mode, if you do not want the BSS section (which holds all
uninitialized global variables) to be created dynamically, you can write
<PRE>#define MERGE_BSS
</PRE>
at the beginning of all files. Unlike the <B>'-mno-bss'</B> compiler switch,
this ensures that the variables are initialized to zero.
