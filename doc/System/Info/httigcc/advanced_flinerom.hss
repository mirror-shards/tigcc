AMS 2.04 and higher support a method of calling ROM calls in a way that is shorter
than any other way, but very slow. If you want to use this method, write
<PRE>#define USE_FLINE_ROM_CALLS
</PRE>
at the beginning of the program. However, you need to <A HREF="$$LINK(minams)">define a minimum AMS version</A>
for your program if you want to use this. You can bypass this, assuming that the user
has installed an emulator for Line 1111 ROM calls, by defining <CODE>USE_FLINE_EMULATOR</CODE>.
Alternatively, you can even define <CODE>USE_INTERNAL_FLINE_EMULATOR</CODE>
to make the program install its own handler for Line 1111 ROM calls.

<B>Note:</B> The Line 1111 handler of the AMS does not support calling TIOS
functions from interrupts. If you want to use your own interrupt handlers for
something, you will have to define <CODE>USE_INTERNAL_FLINE_EMULATOR</CODE>.
