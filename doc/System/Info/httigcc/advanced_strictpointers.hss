Title=STRICT_POINTERS

[Top]
If functions from the TIGCC Library take a pointer to an unsigned integer as an argument,
you can usually pass a signed integer as well. However, this may not be desirable,
as the function may write values to it which the turn out to be negative.
The same is true the other way. To prevent this, use
<PRE>#define STRICT_POINTERS
</PRE>
