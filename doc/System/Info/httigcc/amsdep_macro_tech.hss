Title=Wrapping a ROM Function with a Macro

[Top]
Sometimes a ROM function exists as a normal ROM call in the jump table, but
for some reason it is not usable in a direct way. This means that it has to
be implemented either using macros or using a wrapper function in
<CODE>tigcc.a</CODE>. Using a macro prevents you from taking the address of
the function and therefore from using it as a callback function.

This does not have to be related to an AMS dependency, although it is in the
special case of <A HREF="$$LINK(system.h/XR_stringPtr)">XR_stringPtr</A>.
In fact, all functions returning
<CODE><A HREF="$$INFOLINK(keywords/float)">float</A></CODE> values are
implemented in this way, since the TIOS method of returning floats is strange
to say the least.
