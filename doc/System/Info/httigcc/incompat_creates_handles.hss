Title=INCOMPAT_CREATES_HANDLES

[Top]
If your program allocates memory which may not be freed automatically after
exiting the program, and which does not belong to a
<A HREF="$$LINK(vat.h/)">VAT</A> symbol or
<A HREF="$$LINK(homescr.h/)">home screen</A> item, you should write
<PRE>#define INCOMPAT_CREATES_HANDLES
</PRE>
at the top of at least one source file, before including any header file
from the TIGCC Library. This especially refers to TSRs that allocate memory.
If a shell or another tool freed the memory, the calculator would crash
sooner or later. This directive should prevent such tools from automatically
freeing memory allocated by the program.
