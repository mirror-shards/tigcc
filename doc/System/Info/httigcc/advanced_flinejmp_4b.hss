Normal <A HREF="$$LINK(advanced_flinejmp)">F-Line jumps</A> take 6 bytes, but
if they are not pc-relative but relative to the beginning of the program,
they can fit into 4 bytes. To activate 4-byte F-Line jumps, put
<PRE>#define USE_4_BYTE_FLINE_JUMPS
</PRE>
at the beginning of the program. However, only the internal F-Line emulator
supports such jumps, so you need to define
<CODE>USE_INTERNAL_FLINE_EMULATOR</CODE> as well, to make the program install
its own handler for Line 1111 jumps.

<B>Note:</B> Since 4-byte F-Line jumps use codes that are otherwise used for
ROM calls, this might break applications that are called from the program, if
any. However, this is very unlikely, as the two ROM calls used are not
defined yet.

This feature uses the linker-specific symbol
<A HREF="$$INFOLINK(ld/control_ld_use_4byte_fline_jumps)">__ld_use_4byte_fline_jumps</A>.
