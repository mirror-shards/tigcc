[Top]
To include user-visible version information in the program, write
<PRE>#define COMMENT_VERSION_STRING "<I>version</I>"
</PRE>
at the top of your source code. If supported by the target format, this will
include the text inside the quotes as a version string. It can have an
arbitrary format, but it should be recognizable as a program version, for
example <CODE><I>major</I>.<I>minor</I></CODE>.
