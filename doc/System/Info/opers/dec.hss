Title=Decrement operator ('--')
Index=--

[Top]
The decrement operator may be used as a postdecrement or predecrement operator:
<PRE><I>expr</I> --           (postdecrement)
-- <I>expr</I>           (predecrement)
</PRE>
The decrement operator follows the same rules as the <A HREF="$$LINK(inc)">increment operator</A>,
except that the operand is decremented by 1 after or before the whole
expression is evaluated.
