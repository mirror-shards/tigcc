Title=Naming the Object File

[Top]
There is always one object file output when you run <CODE>as</CODE>.  By
default it has the name
<CODE>a.out</CODE>.
You can use the <B>'-o'</B> option (which takes exactly one filename) to give the
object file a different name.
<BR><BR>
Whatever the object file is called, <CODE>as</CODE> overwrites any
existing file of the same name.
