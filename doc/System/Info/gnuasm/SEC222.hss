Title=Special Characters

[Top]
The immediate character is <CODE>#</CODE> for Sun compatibility.  The
line-comment character is <CODE>|</CODE> (unless the <B>'--bitwise-or'</B>
option is used).  If a <CODE>#</CODE> appears at the beginning of a line, it
is treated as a comment unless it looks like <CODE>#&nbsp;line&nbsp;file</CODE>, in
which case it is treated normally.
