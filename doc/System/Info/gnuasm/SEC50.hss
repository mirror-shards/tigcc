Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes &quot;Value&quot; and
&quot;Type&quot;.  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.
If you use a symbol without defining it, <CODE>as</CODE> assumes zero for
all these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the
symbol an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you
would want.
