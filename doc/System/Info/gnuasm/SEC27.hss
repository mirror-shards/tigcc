Title=Whitespace

[Top]
<U>Whitespace</U> is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.
Whitespace is used to separate symbols, and to make programs neater for
people to read.  Unless within character constants
(see <A HREF="$$LINK(SEC32)">Character Constants</A>), any whitespace means the same
as exactly one space.
