Title=.int

[Top]
Syntax: <B>.int <I>expressions</I></B>
<BR><BR>
Expect zero or more <I>expressions</I>, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of that
expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on what kind
of target the assembly is for (big endian 32-bit for MC 68000;
be aware that in TIGCC, C language <CODE>int</CODE> variables occupy 16 bits by default).
