Title=Labels

[Top]
A <U>label</U> is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
<CODE>:</CODE>.  The symbol then represents the current value of the
active location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction
operand.  You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two
different locations: the first definition overrides any other
definitions.
