Title=.nolist

[Top]
Control (in conjunction with the <CODE><A HREF="$$LINK(SEC107)">.list</A></CODE> directive) whether or
not assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).  <CODE>.list</CODE> increments the
counter, and <CODE>.nolist</CODE> decrements it.  Assembly listings are
generated whenever the counter is greater than zero.
