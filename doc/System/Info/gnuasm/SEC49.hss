Title=The Special Dot Symbol

[Top]
The special symbol <CODE>.</CODE> refers to the current address that
<CODE>as</CODE> is assembling into.  Thus, the expression <CODE>melvin:
.long&nbsp;.</CODE> defines <CODE>melvin</CODE> to contain its own address.
Assigning a value to <CODE>.</CODE> is treated the same as a <CODE>.org</CODE>
directive.  Thus, the expression <CODE>.=.+4</CODE> is the same as saying
<CODE>.space&nbsp;4</CODE>.
