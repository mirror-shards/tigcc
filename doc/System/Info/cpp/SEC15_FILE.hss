Title=__FILE__

[Top]
This macro expands to the name of the current input file, in the form of
a C string constant.  This is the path by which the preprocessor opened
the file, not the short name specified in <CODE><A HREF="$$LINK(SEC6)">#include</A></CODE> or as the
input file name argument.  For example,
<CODE>&quot;/usr/local/include/myheader.h&quot;</CODE> is a possible expansion of this
macro.
