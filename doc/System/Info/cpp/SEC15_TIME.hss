Title=__TIME__

[Top]
This macro expands to a string constant that describes the time at
which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
eight characters and looks like <CODE>&quot;23:59:01&quot;</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
If GCC cannot determine the current time, it will emit a warning message
(once per compilation) and <CODE>__TIME__</CODE> will expand to
<CODE>&quot;??:??:??&quot;</CODE>.
