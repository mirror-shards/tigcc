In normal operation, this macro expands to the constant 1, to signify
that this compiler conforms to ISO Standard C.  If GNU CPP is used with
a compiler other than GCC, this is not necessarily true; however, the
preprocessor always conforms to the standard unless the
<B>'-traditional-cpp'</B> option is used.
<BR><BR>
This macro is not defined if the <B>'-traditional-cpp'</B> option is used.
