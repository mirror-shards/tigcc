Title=__STRICT_ANSI__

[Top]
GCC defines this macro if and only if the <B>'-ansi'</B> switch, or a
<B>'-std'</B> switch specifying strict conformance to some version of ISO C,
was specified when GCC was invoked.  It is defined to <CODE>1</CODE>.
This macro exists primarily to direct GNU libc's header files to
restrict their definitions to the minimal set found in the 1989 C
standard.
