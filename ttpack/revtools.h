*
* examine one of the pctools source codes to see how it works ;-)

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// [Usage]
//
// (1) include this file into your tool
//
//
// (2) AFTER (!!) all includes put the following lines into your source code:
//
// #ifdef CVS_FILE_REVISION
// #undef CVS_FILE_REVISION
// #endif
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DON'T EDIT THE NEXT REVISION BY HAND! THIS IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY BY THE
// CVS SYSTEM !!!
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// #define CVS_FILE_REVISION "$Revision$"
//
// It must be placed AFTER (!!) all includes otherwise the macros may be
// expanded wrong where you use them. For example: if you have added the above
// lines at the top of your file and include afterwards a file which does
// the same, the version of the included file will be used further due to the
// #undef CVS_FILE_REVISION. Everything clear?
//
//
// (3) to output the cvs revision number you can now to a simple:
//
// printf(CVSREV_PRINTPARAMS)
//
// if your file has, for example, the revision 1.3 the following string will
// be printed:  v1.03
//
// the prefix before the subversion is used to get equal-sized output strings
// for mainversions between 1 ... 9 and subversion between 1 .. 99
//
// if your program leaves that range and you need to have equal-sized output
// strings you have to implement it by your own by using the
// CVSREV_MAIN and CVSREV_SUB macros which returns the main and sub versions
// as plain integers. if there is something wrong with your revision string
// CVSREV_MAIN and/or CVSREV_SUB will deliver 0, which is no valid CVS main
// or subversion number.
//
// i will suggest that you use the CVS system. its simple to handle, keeps
// track of your revisions and their history and with the smart macros below
// you haven't to worry anymore about the version output strings of your
// program. if you want a special version number you can force CVS at every
// time to give this version number to your program (0 is not allowed as
// main and subversion number - thats the only pity)
//
// within this tools suite every tool will use the automatic version handling
// but the tool suite version number itself will be handled "by hand".
// this number shouldn't change that quickly as with the tools.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTE: THE FOLLOWING MACRO WILL ONLY HANDLE MAIN VERSION < 10 AT CONSTANT
//       LENGTH !!!
//       (subversions from 1 .. 99 are mapped to 01 .. 99)
//
// the following macro may be used to setup a printf(),sprintf() or fprintf()
// call
