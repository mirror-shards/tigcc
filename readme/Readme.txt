2. About TIGCC
--------------

TIGCC is our attempt to make it possible to program in C for the TI-89 and
TI-92 Plus. To do this we originally recompiled a version of GCC-M68k (which
was found at http://fiddes.net/coldfire/) to make it work with the C calling
convention used by TI's compiler. Much later, this was replaced by the
original GCC found at http://www.cygwin.com. Then we wrote a linker to make
it produce .89z or .9xz files. And since we also wanted to allow the use of
assembly, we programmed it so that you can use the .asm files and compile
them with a68k. Finally we wrote tigcc.exe, a program which will
automatically call the necessary programs to compile everything you specify
in the command line. Additional items, such as the TIGCC Library and the IDE,
have been added to TIGCC over time. The most recent important change is the
addition of native floating point support, which was made possible by
recompiling GCC again.

Please check out tigcc.ticalc.org, the official TIGCC site, for more
information.

3. Installation
---------------

In the ZIP file containing TIGCC, you will find a program called 'Setup.exe'.
Run this program and follow the instructions of the setup program. It will
add a few new items to your start menu, so you should not use a program group
that already exists.

If you want to uninstall TIGCC, you can do this at any time from either the
start menu or the control panel. Please be aware that this will remove the
whole folder in which the program was installed, not only the files which
were installed by the setup program.

If you experience any problems installing TIGCC, or running it after it has
been installed, please use the bug report form on tigcc.ticalc.org.

4. The Library
--------------

The library included in this release of TIGCC is a collection of over 750
functions. With this library, it is possible to create kernel-free (so-called
"nostub") programs as well as programs that make use of kernel features. A
very detailed documentation in HTML Help format is included, in which more
than 600 TIOS entries are described in detail. This documentation may be very
valuable for assembly programmers too. To read the documentation, open
'tigcc.chm', located in the 'Doc' folder, or click on the appropriate item in
the start menu.

5. The Command Line Compiler
----------------------------

The following paragraphs apply only to the command line compiler. If you want
to use the IDE instead, you do not need to worry about these topics.

The command line compiler (tigcc.exe) works almost the same way that the
standard gcc.exe does. Aside from accepting .asm files as parameters and
calling the a68k assembler to compile them, it also supports a few
non-standard options:

-pack <varname>
  Compress the file generated during compilation. 'varname' is the name of
  the on-calc packed variable. Although 'varname' cannot have an extension,
  the variable on the calculator will always have the extension 'ppg'.
  'varname' cannot be the same as the on-calc name of the program itself.
  When you use this switch, two variables will be created; one with the
  extension '.89y' or '.9xy', and one '.89z' or '.9xz' variable.
  This option comes from Thomas Nussbaumer's (thomas.nussbaumer@gmx.net)
  excellent TIGCC Tools Suite, where this feature is called "ExePack
  Technology." You can read about it on the official TI-Chess Team site
  (tict.ticalc.org).

-q
  Keep as quiet as possible while assembling and linking. This option is not
  needed by the compiler because it is always quiet, but the linker and
  especially the assembler output some information.

-v0
  This switch is an addition to the '-v' switch. It tells tigcc.exe to output
  only the commands that are run directly. This was the default in some
  previous releases.

-g
  The '-g' switch in GCC turns on debugging information; in TIGCC the COFF
  format will be used in all cases. If you use this option in TIGCC, the .s
  file will not be deleted, but instead it will be filled with lines from
  the C source along with file offsets as comments.

-standalone
  Do not link against tigcc.a. All of GCC's internal functions are
  implemented in this library, as well as all non-TIOS functions. Using one
  of these will result in an error from the linker.

-ar
  Create an archive (a static library) instead of a program. The resulting
  file will have a '.a' ending.

-bsr
  This option is ignored for compatibility.

For more info about standard options that are recognized by the compiler,
have a look at the TIGCC Documentation, or visit
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc_3.html.

In addition, you can use '-WA,...' instead of '-Wa,...' to pass options to
the A68k assembler.

We suggest that you use the '-O2' or '-Os' switch in all your compilations;
it increases speed and decreases the program size at the cost of compilation
time.

There is an important difference to the standard gcc.exe: tigcc.exe always
overwrites assembly or object files. For example, if a file 'test.c' is
compiled, the files 'test.s' and 'test.o' will be created and overwritten if
necessary, but they will automatically be deleted again if neither '-c' or
'-S' nor '-g' are specified.

6. The IDE
----------

Documentation of the IDE is included in the manual and will be installed by
the setup program. You can access it from the start menu or from the IDE
itself.

7. Examples
-----------

There are some examples made by Zeljko Juric in the folder "Examples". You
can compile and modify them to learn how to use TIGCC. Most of them can also
be found at some place in the documentation, with explanations and in some
sort of context.

8. Missing Features
-------------------

There are still some restrictions:

- The library is very advanced, but not totally finished yet.
- There is still no C debugger.

9. Bug Reports
--------------

There may still be some bugs in the linker, in tigcc.exe, and in the IDE. If
you encounter a bug, please use the bug report form on tigcc.ticalc.org.
