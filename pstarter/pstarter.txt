This is the next-generation TIGCC pstarter. I wanted to get rid of all the #ifdef
mess in ttstart, instead concentrating on a launcher explicitly optimized for use
as an automatic TIGCC decompressor. There are 4 supported decompresssion
routines:
* ttunpack-small
* ttunpack-fast
* LZMA
* Shrink92
